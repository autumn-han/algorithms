// prompt: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
// The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.
// Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
// You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

// test case
// input: l1 = [2, 4, 3], l2 = [5, 6, 4]
// output: [7. 0, 8]
// explanation: 342 + 465 = 807

function addTwoNumbers(l1, l2) {
  // take the last node of l1 and move through to head of linked list - store in as variable
  // do the above with the l2
  // find sum of tempL1 and tempL2
  // store sum in reverse into a linked list l3
  // return l3
}
